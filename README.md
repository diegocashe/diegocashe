## Hello there! :wave:
I am Diego :sunglasses: or @diegocashe as my user says, I am a systems engineer who likes to automate a lot, 
lately I work with web technologies to create attractive solutions for my clients (and my friends), 
because it is my job but also my hobby :star2: and I enjoy design, create and implement my projects.

I like challenges :boom:, work in an orderly way :eyes:, share with my family, friends and fellow developers :family: ... and Soccer :soccer:, Hala Madrid !!.

I handle the following technologies:
